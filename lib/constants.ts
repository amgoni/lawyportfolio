  This residential project was commissioned by a young professional looking to transform a modest bungalow into a modern, light-filled home tailored to their lifestyle. The primary goal was to open up the layout and create a seamless flow between the living, kitchen, and outdoor areas, while preserving some of the home's original character.

  After exploring several layout options, the final design featured a spacious open-plan living area, a custom kitchen with built-in storage, and an extended rear terrace for indoor-outdoor living. Natural light, clean lines, and warm textures were central to the design approach.

  Throughout the project, close collaboration with the client led to bold design choices and carefully selected finishes that reflected their personality. The result is a functional and expressive space that balances comfort, style, and thoughtful detail.

  This residential project was commissioned by a young professional looking to transform a modest bungalow into a modern, light-filled home tailored to their lifestyle. The primary goal was to open up the layout and create a seamless flow between the living, kitchen, and outdoor areas, while preserving some of the home's original character.

  After exploring several layout options, the final design featured a spacious open-plan living area, a custom kitchen with built-in storage, and an extended rear terrace for indoor-outdoor living. Natural light, clean lines, and warm textures were central to the design approach.

  Throughout the project, close collaboration with the client led to bold design choices and carefully selected finishes that reflected their personality. The result is a functional and expressive space that balances comfort, style, and thoughtful detail.

  This residential project was commissioned by a young professional looking to transform a modest bungalow into a modern, light-filled home tailored to their lifestyle. The primary goal was to open up the layout and create a seamless flow between the living, kitchen, and outdoor areas, while preserving some of the home's original character.

  After exploring several layout options, the final design featured a spacious open-plan living area, a custom kitchen with built-in storage, and an extended rear terrace for indoor-outdoor living. Natural light, clean lines, and warm textures were central to the design approach.

  Throughout the project, close collaboration with the client led to bold design choices and carefully selected finishes that reflected their personality. The result is a functional and expressive space that balances comfort, style, and thoughtful detail.
